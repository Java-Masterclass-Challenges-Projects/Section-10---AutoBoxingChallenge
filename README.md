# ðŸ’³ Simple Banking App â€“ Java (Autoboxing & Unboxing)

This is a small banking application written in Java that demonstrates the use of **autoboxing** and **unboxing** â€” the automatic conversion between primitive types and their wrapper classes. It was built as part of my Java Masterclass coursework and serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce these core concepts.

## ðŸ“˜ What It Does

- Allows creation of a **Bank** with a name and multiple **Customers**
- Supports adding **Customers** to the bank if they donâ€™t already exist
- Lets each **Customer** store a list of **transactions** (credits and debits)
- Enables adding **transactions** to a customerâ€™s record
- Prints out a **transaction statement** for a customer, using **unboxing** to convert `Double` objects to `double` primitives

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced

- **Autoboxing:** Automatically converting `double` to `Double` when adding to an `ArrayList<Double>`
- **Unboxing:** Extracting `Double` values from the list and assigning them to `double` primitives
- **ArrayLists & Object-Oriented Design**
- Java method structure, conditional logic, and encapsulation
